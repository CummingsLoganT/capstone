  My goal is to try to make a comprehensive brainstorming app that will have a visual representation akin to spider diagrams, (radial?) info trees. Different nodes will have the ability to hold links, maybe keywords, descriptions, names, connecting node(s), etc.

                            !!M-V-P!!

!~ visually represent different ideas, things, definitions, etc. using nodes on !a (radial?) spider diagram and/or tree
!~ hover function that shows  semi-detailed view of the nodes
!~ macro and micro organizational options


figure out a way to manipulate the mouseout event to make it feel more intuitive. no idea what that means yet

when you go to grab and move the node have it slowly fold in so it is smaller while positioning it. maybe have a shift-click option that allows for you to position it while it is expanded

!! use different shapes to denote different node templates -website-
!! SOME TYPE OF ALERT LIKE THE WHALE AMBIENCE FROM DIGITAL OCEAN LOOOOOOOl


maybe have frame for the hover content display. smooth transition could feel satisfying and look interesting. figure out a color schema for this with that other website. Ciaran ftw.

on click boxes show contents and have an optional hover option if holding shift is detected. or potentially just have different pointers that trigger different functions

need to figure out solution for linking things based on a dynamic heirarchy

drag and drop from sidebar
