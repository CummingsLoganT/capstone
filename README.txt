I was assigned this as my foundations capstone project for HackBright Optum Cohort 2022. It quickly turned into something I am very passionate about. I have a lot of plans for this project. I'd like to make a 3d interactive brainstorming app for personal use. 

I inadvertantly went off the rails with this project. Didn't take a close look at the rubrick until after I was in the hole I had just dug. If you're wondering if that was a good idea, so am I.
