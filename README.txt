I'd like to make a 3d interactive brainstorming app for personal use. 

for now I'm only uploading the few files that show the drag and drop functionality. if you'd like to test it out, fork it, etc... (he said, to all 3 people that will read this), clone, hit live server.

I was assigned this as my (foundations) Capstone Croject for HackBright Optum Cohort 2022. It quickly turned into something I am very passionate about. I have a lot of plans for this project. 

I inadvertantly went off the rails with this project. Didn't take a close look at the rubrick until after I was in the hole I had just dug. If you're wondering if that was a good idea, so am I.

My end goal might actually be to make a solar system type set up... the different planets would be the nodes. you would have the different layers for different types of notes... core could just be the title of the planet. zoom in and out of the core to be able to see all of the content. no idea how i'd do any of this, but I imagine it isn't in CSS.
